Cove - A Relationship Conflict Resolution App
Cove is a web-based application designed to help couples navigate disagreements, build healthier communication habits, and find moments of calm during conflict. It provides a suite of tools based on established therapeutic techniques to foster better understanding and connection.

✨ Features
The app is built around three core features, allowing users to choose the right tool for their immediate needs:

Resolve a Conflict:

An AI-powered chat interface that acts as a neutral, third-party mediator.

Guides users through a structured conversation, prompting them to use "I" statements and focus on expressing feelings rather than accusations.

Ensures both partners have a chance to feel heard and understood.

Build Healthy Habits:

A proactive skill-building section with guided learning modules.

Features topics like "Small Gestures, Big Impact," "Essential Communication Tips," and "Speaking Your Partner's Love Language."

Includes a calendar to track daily commitments to practicing new habits.

Take a Breather:

An interactive de-escalation tool designed to be used during a heated moment.

Features a guided breathing exercise with a soothing, full-screen animation powered by D3.js.

The animation follows a 15-second inhale, 5-second hold, and 15-second exhale pattern to help regulate the nervous system and promote calmness.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js

Animation: D3.js (for the breathing exercise visualization)

Styling: Inline CSS-in-JS for component-scoped styling.

The entire application is currently contained within a single App.jsx file for simplicity and compatibility with various web-based development environments.

🌐 Deployment
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and can be easily deployed to any static site hosting service. Here are instructions for deploying with Netlify, a popular and straightforward option.

Deploying to Netlify
Build the project for production:

npm run build

This command creates a build folder in your project directory with all the static files needed for deployment.

Deploy via Netlify Drag-and-Drop:

Go to the Netlify website and sign up or log in.

Navigate to your "Sites" dashboard.

Simply drag the build folder from your local project and drop it onto the Netlify dashboard.

Netlify will automatically upload your files and provide you with a live URL for your deployed app.

Deploy via Git Integration (Recommended):

Push your project to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.

On your Netlify dashboard, click "Add new site" -> "Import an existing project."

Connect your Git provider and authorize Netlify.

Select the repository for your Cove app.

Netlify will automatically detect that it is a Create React App project. The build settings should be pre-filled correctly:

Build command: npm run build

Publish directory: build

Click "Deploy site." Netlify will build and deploy your app. It will also automatically redeploy every time you push a new change to your main branch.
